## Xor encryption
### The first thing you need to know is about the xor operation...
### h ^ a
### h => 01101000 in binary , 68 in HEX
### a => 01100001 in binary ,61 in HEX
### 01101000 ^ 01100001=00001001, 68 ^ 61=9
### The problem is that 00001001 does not return any text value.
### To encrypt text you apply t xor operation in all the letters in the file text...
### with a corresponding key,theoriclly if the key is as long as the messague is impossible ...
### to decrypt the message
